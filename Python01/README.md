<h2 align="center">Description</h2>
**Goal:**
The project aims to introduce the Object-Oriented constructs of Python (OOP),
evolving from simple scripts to a complex system of interacting classes.
The simulation handles plant lifecycles, growth tracking, security validation for data integrity,
and advanced reporting systems using inheritance and polymorphism.

**Overview:**
The module consists of several progressive exercises:
* **Level 0-2:** Basic class definitions, `__init__`, and logic loops.
* **Level 3-4:** Encapsulation, protected data, and validation logic.
* **Level 5-6:** Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Complex System Management (Nested Classes, Static Methods).
