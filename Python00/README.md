## Description
**Goal:**
The project aimed to introduce the fundamental constructs of Python,
including the implementation of several simple functions, such as:
ft_hello_garden
ft_plot_area
ft_harvest_total
ft_plant_age
ft_water_reminder
ft_count_harvest_iterative
ft_count_harvest_recursive
ft_garden_summary
ft_seed_inventory

**Overview:**
Each exercise consists of a standalone function designed to produce the specified outputs.
Each function includes a docstring briefly describing its functionality.
